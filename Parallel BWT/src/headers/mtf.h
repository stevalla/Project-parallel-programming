 * @brief 	Header file implementing the move to front transformation.
 *
 * @details This header defines the functions needed to perform the move to
 * 			front (MTF) transformation, that is the second phase of the BWT
 * 			compression. @n
 *			The algorithm takes an input byte and outputs the number of distinct
 *			other bytes that have been seen since its last occurrence. At the
 *			beginning the 0x00 byte is assumed to be the most recently occurred,
 *			with the other bytes in sequence.@n
 *			The implementation is done by means of a list of 256 bytes, where the
 *			most recently seen bytes are kept in order from position 0. When a new
 *			byte is read, its position in the list is output and the byte is moved
 *			in front of the list. The output is still a sequence of bytes
 *			from 0 to 255.
 *
 * @note	If the most recently byte is read, i.e. we have at least two consecutive
 * 			equal characters, the algorithm outputs 0 for the second one.
