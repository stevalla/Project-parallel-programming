 * @brief	Header file implementing the Burrows-Wheeler transformation (BWT).
 *
 * @details This header defines the functions needed to obtain, given a sequence
 * 			of bytes, the Burrows-Wheeler transformation of that sequence. By
 * 			calling the ::bwtTransformation function pssing as argument the sequence
 * 			of bytes, we obtain returned the bwt together with its length. @n
 * 			The function ::getBWT offers the possibility to obtain the BWT, by
 * 			passing as argument the input sequence and the suffix tree of the
 * 			sequence. @n
 * 			Finally the function ::createSuffixArray allows to create the suffix
 * 			array of a sequence of bytes from the suffix tree of that sequence.
