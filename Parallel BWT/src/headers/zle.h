 * @brief 	Header file implementing a zero length encoder.
 *
 * @details This header defines the functions needed to perform the zero length
 * 			encoding, third phase of the BWT compression.
 * 			This type of compression has been developed by D.J.Wheeler and it is a kind
 * 			of run-length encoding, that encodes sequences of zeroes in a number that
 * 			holds the length of the zero-run.
 * 			Given a sequence of zeroes of length N, it converts (N + 1) to binary and
 * 			outputs the binary representation, starting from the LSB and leaving out
 * 			the MSB.<br/>
 *
 * ###Examples
 *
 * - Cleartext sequence of zeroes of length: 1, 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,   7,   8,   9
 * - Encoded: N + 1 in binary, MSB elided:   0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010 @n@n
 *
 * - Cleartext: A byte B = 0x01 or 0x02 or ... or 0xFD
 * - Encoded: B + 1 @n@n
 *
 * - Cleartext: A 0xFE byte
 * - Encoded: 0xFF 0x00 @n@n
 *
 * - Cleartext: A 0xFF byte
 * - Encoded: 0xFF 0x01
